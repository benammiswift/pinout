The `SevenSegmentDisplay` driver is used to drive a single seven segment display module.

## How to wire

The module has 10 pins. 7 of them are for each segment of the display module. One is for the decimal point, and two are common ground.

Each pin should be connected to a [valid GPIO pin](https://pinout.xyz), and you should put a 330 ohm resistor between each LED. This means you will have 8 LEDs.

<Info>You can't just place a single resistor for all the LEDs. If you do this, you'll get varying brightness depending on how many segments are illuminated.</Info>

## Using the driver

Instantiate the driver using the static `make()` function, passing a reference to each pin.

```php
use DanJohnson95\Pinout\Facades\PinService;
use DanJohnson95\Pinout\Drivers\SevenSegmentDisplay;

$driver = SevenSegmentDisplay::make(
    pinA: PinService::pin(13),
    pinB: PinService::pin(14),
    pinC: PinService::pin(15),
    pinD: PinService::pin(16),
    pinE: PinService::pin(17),
    pinF: PinService::pin(18),
    pinG: PinService::pin(19),
    pinDP: PinService::pin(20)
);
```

You can call the following methods on the driver:

### Available methods

#### `renderInteger`

#### `showDecimalPoint`

#### `hideDecimalPoint`

#### `clearDisplay`
