Connect your Laravel application to the physical world with Pinout - a library allowing you to easily interact with hardware.

## Why?

Traditionally, building hardware solutions requires writing code in lower level languages like C. But with Pinout, you can build hardware solutions using PHP, with all the Laravel features you know and love.

## How does it work?

Run your Laravel application directly on your Raspberry Pi, and connect your hardware to the GPIO pins.

In your Laravel application, you can use the `PinService` facade to control
individual pins. Or you can use the included drivers to interact with more
complex hardware, such as LCD displays.

## What kind of things can I build?

The possibilities are endless, but here are a few ideas to get you started:

- Smart plug relay
- Alarm clock
- Weather station
- Followers counter
