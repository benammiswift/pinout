You can use the `PinService` facade anywhere in your Laravel code to get a reference to a pin using the `pin()` method.

Pass the [pin number](https://pinout.xyz) as the argument.

From there, you can use the `turnOn()` and `turnOff()` methods to manage the power state of output pins.

```php
use DanJohnson95\Pinout\Facades\PinService;

$pin = PinService::pin(13);

$pin->turnOn();

$pin->turnOff();
```
