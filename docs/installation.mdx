## Requirements

1. A [supported model of Raspberry Pi](/supported-hardware)
2. PHP 8.1 or higher
3. Laravel 10 or higher
4. Some hardware!

## Connecting to the Raspberry Pi

Because your Laravel package runs directly on the Pi, you'll need to write your code on it and run commands on it too.

There are two ways to do this:

1) Connect your Pi to the internet, and communicate over SSH. You can use the VSCode [Remote Development over SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) extension to write code from VSCode on your laptop.
2) Connect a screen, keyboard and mouse to your Pi, and develop directly on your Pi.

## Install the package

Run the following command on your Pi within your Laravel project to install the package:

```bash
composer require danjohnson95/pinout
```

And that's it. Laravel will auto-discover the package, so you're ready to start interacting with hardware.
